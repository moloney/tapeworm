Intro
-----

These are the configuration files to use with mhVTL to provide the virtual 
tape library setup needed to run the automated test suite. The device 
identifiers are all set to 'TWTST" (TapeWorm TeST) to avoid using any real 
tape libraries (or production use VTL).

You need to overwrite the files in the mhVTL configuration directory 
(ie. /etc/mhvtl) with the ones provided here and then the service must be 
(re)started. The user running the tests must have permissions to use all the 
required commands (lsscsi, mtx, mt, etc) on the mhVTL devices.
